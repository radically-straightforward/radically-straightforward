# Changelog

## 2.0.3 · 2024-11-07

**Breaking Changes**

- Changed `address` into `hostname`.
- Changed `email` into `systemAdministratorEmail`.
- Changed `dynamicServerPorts` into `ports`.
- Changed the default for `untrustedStaticFilesRoots` from ``[`/files/* "${path.join(process.cwd(), "data")}"`]`` to `[]`.

## 1.4.3 · 2024-05-14

- Added `dataDirectory()`.

## 1.4.1 · 2024-05-03

## 1.4.0 · 2024-04-28

- Added `start()`.

## 1.3.3 · 2024-04-26

- Removed compression from `application()`, because for some reason it breaks streaming HTTP responses.

## 1.3.2 · 2024-04-09

- Added `staticFiles`.

## 1.3.1 · 2024-03-31

- Fixed the default value of `application()`’s `trustedStaticFilesRoots`.

## 1.1.3 · 2024-02-23

- Fixed issues with tests in previous release.

## 1.1.2 · 2024-02-23

- Added `bin` to try and fix `npx @radically-straightforward/caddy`.

## 1.1.1 · 2024-02-23

- Fixed package, which included the executable and a bunch of bundled dependencies by accident.

## 1.1.0 · 2024-02-23

- Introduce a template with a Caddy configuration for applications.
- Install Caddy via the npm `bin` mechanism, which subsumes the `postuninstall` script.

- Initial release, migrating from `@leafac/caddy`.
- Added automated tests.
