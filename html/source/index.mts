/**
 * A [tagged template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates) for HTML:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * html`<p>Leandro Facchinetti</p>`;
 * ```
 *
 * Sanitizes interpolations to prevent injection attacks:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * html`<p>${"Leandro Facchinetti"}</p>`;
 * // => `<p>Leandro Facchinetti</p>`
 * html`<p>${`<script>alert(1);</script>`}</p>`;
 * // => `<p>&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;</p>`
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note:** Sanitization is only part of the defense against injection attacks. Also deploy the following measures:
 * >
 * > - Serve your pages with UTF-8 encoding.
 * > - Have your server send the header `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`.
 * > - If you want to be extra sure that the encoding will be picked up by the browser, include a `<meta charset="utf-8" />` meta tag. (But HTML 5 documents must be encoded in UTF-8, so it should be sufficient to declare your document as HTML 5 by starting it with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.)
 * > - Always use quotes around HTML attributes (for example, `href="https://leafac.com"` instead of `href=https://leafac.com`).
 * > - See <https://wonko.com/post/html-escaping/>.
 *
 * > **Note:** This library works by concatenating strings. It doesn’t prettify the output (if you need that you may, for example, call [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) programmatically on the output of `` html`___` ``), and it doesn’t generate any kind of [virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html). The virtues of this approach are that this library is conceptually simple and it is one order of magnitude faster than [`ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToStaticMarkup) (performance matters because rendering may be one of the most time-consuming tasks in responding to a request).
 *
 * Opt out of sanitization with `$${___}` instead of `${___}`:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * html`<div>$${`<p>Leandro Facchinetti</p>`}</div>`;
 * // => `<div><p>Leandro Facchinetti</p></div>`
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note:** Only opt out of sanitization if you are sure that the interpolated string is safe, in particular it must not contain user input, otherwise you’d be open to injection attacks:
 * >
 * > ```typescript
 * > html`<div>$${`<script>alert(1);</script>`}</div>`;
 * > // => `<div><script>alert(1);</script></div>`
 * > ```
 *
 * > **Note:** You must opt out of sanitization when the interpolated string is itself the result of `` html`___` ``, otherwise the escaping would be doubled:
 * >
 * > ```typescript
 * > html`
 * >   <div>
 * >     Good (escape once): $${html`<p>${`<script>alert(1);</script>`}</p>`}
 * >   </div>
 * > `;
 * > // =>
 * > // `
 * > //   <div>
 * > //     Good (escape once): <p>&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;</p>
 * > //   </div>
 * > // `
 * >
 * > html`
 * >   <div>
 * >     Bad (double escaping): ${html`<p>${`<script>alert(1);</script>`}</p>`}
 * >   </div>
 * > `;
 * > // =>
 * > // `
 * > //   <div>
 * > //     Bad (double escaping): &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(1);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 * > //   </div>
 * > // `
 * > ```
 *
 * > **Note:** As an edge case, if you need a literal `$` before an interpolation, interpolate the `$` itself:
 * >
 * > ```typescript
 * > html`<p>${"$"}${"Leandro Facchinetti"}</p>`;
 * > // => `<p>$Leandro Facchinetti</p>`
 * > ```
 *
 * Interpolated arrays are joined:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * html`<p>${["Leandro", " ", "Facchinetti"]}</p>`;
 * // => `<p>Leandro Facchinetti</p>`
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note:** Interpolated arrays are sanitized:
 * >
 * > ```typescript
 * > html`
 * >   <p>${["Leandro", " ", "<script>alert(1);</script>", " ", "Facchinetti"]}</p>
 * > `;
 * > // =>
 * > // `
 * > //   <p>Leandro &lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt; Facchinetti</p>
 * > // `
 * > ```
 * >
 * > You may opt out of the sanitization of interpolated arrays by using `$${___}` instead of `${___}`:
 * >
 * > ```typescript

 * >   <ul>
 * >     $${[html`<li>Leandro</li>`, html`<li>Facchinetti</li>`]}

/**
 * Sanitize text for safe insertion in HTML.
 *
 * `sanitize()` escapes characters that are meaningful in HTML syntax and replaces invalid XML characters with a string of your choosing—by default, an empty string (`""`). You may provide the `replacement` as a parameter or set a new default by overwriting `sanitize.replacement`. For example, to use the [Unicode replacement character](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character>):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * sanitize.replacement = "�";
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note:** The `` html`___` `` tagged template already calls `sanitize()`, so you must **not** call `sanitize()` yourself or the sanitization would happen twice.
 *
 * > **Note:** The sanitization to which we refer here is at the character level, not cleaning up certain tags while preserving others. For that, we recommend [`rehype-sanitize`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-sanitize).
 *
 * > **Note:** Even this sanitization isn’t enough in certain contexts, for example, HTML attributes without quotes (`<a href=${sanitize(___)}>`) could still lead to XSS attacks.

/**
 * Escape characters that are meaningful in HTML syntax.
 *
 * What sets this implementation apart from existing ones are the following:
 *
 * - **Performance.**
 *
 *   The performance of the `escape()` function matters because it’s used frequently to escape user input when rendering HTML with the `` html`___` `` tagged template.
 *
 *   The following are some details on how this implementation is made faster:
 *   - The relatively new string function `replaceAll()` when used with a string parameter is faster than `replace()` with a regular expression.
 *
 *   - Perhaps surprisingly, calling `replaceAll()` multiple times is faster than using a single regular expression of the kind `/[&<>"']/g`.
 *
 *   - And even if we were to use a single regular expression, using `switch/case` would have been faster than the lookup tables that most other implementations use.
 *
 *   - And also if we were to use regular expressions, using the flag `v` incurs on a very small but consistent performance penalty.
 *
 *   - And also if we were to use regular expressions, `replace()` is marginally but consistently faster than `replaceAll()`.
 *
 *   - Measurements performed in Node.js 21.2.0.
 *
 * - **Supports modern browsers only.**
 *
 *   Most other implementations escape characters such as `` ` ``, which could cause problems in Internet Explorer 8 and older.
 *
 *   Some other implementations avoid transforming `'` into the entity `&apos;`, because that entity isn’t understood by some versions of Internet Explorer.

/**
 * A regular expression that matches invalid XML characters.
 *
 * Use this to remove or replace invalid XML characters, or simply to detect that a string doesn’t contain them. This is particularly useful when generating XML based on user input.
 *
 * This list is based on **Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 (Second Edition), § 2.2 Characters** (https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#charsets). In particular, it includes:
 *
 * 1. `\u{0}`, which is always invalid in XML.
 * 2. The gaps between the allowed ranges in the production rule for `[2] Char` from the “Character Range” grammar.
 * 3. The discouraged characters from the **Note** in that section of the document.
 *
 * Notably, it does **not** include the “"compatibility characters", as defined in Unicode” mentioned in that section of the document, because that list was difficult to find and doesn’t seem to be very important.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * someUserInput.replace(invalidXMLCharacters, ""); // Remove invalid XML characters.
 * someUserInput.replace(invalidXMLCharacters, "�"); // Replace invalid XML characters with the Unicode replacement character.
 * someUserInput.match(invalidXMLCharacters); // Detect whether there are invalid XML characters.
 * ```

 *   1. We export the regular expression, instead of encapsulating it in auxiliary functions, which arguably makes it more useful.
 *   2. We are more strict on what we consider to be valid characters (see description above).
